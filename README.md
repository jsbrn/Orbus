# Orbus #

A game about collecting orbs and sabotaging the enemy team. I'm making it open source because it was a small summer project.

This is not a Maven project (yet), so set up is manual:

* Create a project in your favorite IDE.
* Copy the source files into the project.
* Download and add the libraries to the project (see below)

### Libraries ###

* Slick2D
* LWJGL
* Kryonet 2.20-all
* Jogg/Jorbis (sound libraries)

### Help ###

Just shoot me a message if you run into troubles.
